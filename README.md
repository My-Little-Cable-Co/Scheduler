# MyLittleCableCo/Scheduler

This Ruby on Rails application is the heart of a MyLittleCableCo system. It is
the database of all available TV Shows, Movies, and Commercials, along with
the scheduling system for each channel. Additionally, it provides the guide
channel.

I use docker compose to run this rails application and the postgres database
it requires.
